    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office where they refer to themselves as "True Democrats". Keep in mind, parasites drink blood and this is to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is this Tick's plan to suck you dry:
    <ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase
      <li> Property Tax Cap REMOVAL
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases
      <li> Sanctuary City Laws - Just another form of tax increases
    </ul>
