    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office where they refer to themselves as "True Democrats". Keep in mind, a parasite consumes you to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is this Tick plans to consume you:
    <ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase
      <li> Property Tax Cap REMOVAL
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases
      <li> Sanctuary City Laws
      <li> A True Democrat? John F. Kennedy was a True Democrat. I knew John F. Kennedy; I worked with John F. Kennedy. Tick, you are NO John F. Kennedy. You are the Leftist fringe. John F. Kennedy, a TRUE Democrat, was for tax cuts to increase revenues to the state (insert link here to Kennedy's famous speech on this topic...the one he gave shortly before being assassinated, ;) ). Tick would be unrecognizable to John F. Kennedy would see Tick as a Left wing extremeist rather than as a fellow Democrat.
