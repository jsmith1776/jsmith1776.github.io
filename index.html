    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a blood sucking parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office!</p>
    </p>
    <p> Who IS Tick Segerblom? </p>
    <ul>
      <li> 	Tick is currently a State Senate where he has two years remaining in office in Carson City. </li>
	  <li>  He markets himself as a 'True Democrat'. Whatever that means**.</li>
	  <li>  His claim to fame is pushing for the legalization of marijuana in Nevada.</li>
	  <li>  He sold us on marijuana by assuring us the proceeds from marijuana taxation would fund our schools</li>
	  <li>  It turns out those proceeds did NOT go to the schools. They went to the general fund instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> Keep in mind, Ticks suck blood to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is this Tick's plan to suck you dry: </p>
	</ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase
      <li> Property Tax Cap REMOVAL
      <li> Gas Tax Increase
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases
      <li> Sanctuary City Laws - Just another form of tax increases
    </ul>
