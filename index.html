    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a blood sucking parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office!</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Who is Tick Segerblom?</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="padding:10px;">Tick is currently a State Senate where he has two years remaining in office in Carson City. </li>
      <li style="padding:10px;">He markets himself as a 'True Democrat'. Whatever that means**.</li>
      <li style="padding:10px;">His claim to fame is pushing for the legalization of marijuana in Nevada.</li>
      <li style="padding:10px;">He sold us on marijuana by assuring us the proceeds from marijuana taxation would fund our schools</li>
      <li style="padding:10px;">It turns out those proceeds did NOT go to the schools. They went to the general fund instead.</li>
    </ul>
	<br/>
	<p>Keep in mind, Ticks suck blood to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is this Tick's plan to suck you dry: </p>
	<ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase - A ONE percent increase in our already high sales tax!!</li>
      <li> Eliminating the Property Tax Cap - CAP is a limit to the amount our property taxes can increase each year. Elimination of this could mean an enormous increase in our property taxes. Everyone will be affected by this, particularly the elderly who are on fixed incomes and have made assumptions about their retirement income based on the property tax cap. Even non owners will be affected as rents will rise to meet the tax increase to the owner.</li>
      <li> Gas Tax Increase</li>
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases - This is effectively a tax on us all. EVERYTHING you purchase will increase in price to pay for the new labor cost. Of course, with those higher prices will come greater sales tax revenue to the state.</li>
      <li> Sanctuary Status - This is yet another disguised tax on us all. Protecting and supporting those here illegally will add to the burden on our schools, hospitals, prisons, and all public services. And, of course, who is left with the bill for this increase cost in public services? We, the hardworking taxpayers! Of course, as is always the case with those calling for this type of nonsense, Tick lives comfortably in the well policed gated community of Scotch Eighties.</li>
    </ul>
    <br> And, what is it Tick intends to do with these tax increases???</br>
    <br>Fund the schools!!</br>
	<br>Sound familiar??</br>
	<br>Why is he proposing higher taxes to fund schools when the marijuana tax was supposed to do this?</br> 
	<br>What is going to happen when, as with the marijuana promise, these new tax revenues don't end up going to the schools? As the old saying goes, 'when you only know how to use a hammer everything looks like a nail.'  Based on history the answer is clear: Tick will propose even more taxes! ></br>
