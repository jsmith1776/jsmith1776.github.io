    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office where they refer to themselves as "True Democrats". Keep in mind, all parasites consume YOUR blood to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is what this one advocates:
    <ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase
      <li> Property Tax Cap REMOVAL
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases
      <li> Sanctuary City Laws
      <li> A True Democrat? John F. Kennedy was a True Democrat. Tick is part of the fringe Left. This movement has led the Democrat party off the left edge of the cliff. He and his breed are causing mass migrations away from the Democrat Party.
    </ul>
