    <p>You may have thought a Tick was simply a parasite. Well, it turns out they also run for political office where they refer to themselves as "True Democrats". Keep in mind, a parasite consumes you to YOUR detriment and THEIR betterment. Here is this Tick plans to consume you:
    <ul>
      <li> Sales Tax Increase
      <li> Property Tax Cap REMOVAL
      <li> Minimum Wage Increases
      <li> Sanctuary City Laws
      <li> A True Democrat? John F. Kennedy was a True Democrat. Tick, I knew John F. Kennedy; I worked with John F. Kennedy; You are NO John F. Kennedy. Tick is the Leftist fringe. John F. Kennedy, a TRUE Democrat, was for tax cuts to expand the economy, jobs, wages, AND to increase revenues to the state*. Tick would be unrecognizable to John F. Kennedy who would see Tick as a Left wing extremeist rather than as a fellow Democrat.
    </ul>

    <p>* (Declaring that the absence of recession is not tantamount to economic growth, the president proposed in 1963 to cut income taxes from a range of 20-91% to 14-65% He also proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate from 52% to 47%. Ironically, economic growth expanded in 1963, and Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress insisted that reducing taxes without corresponding spending cuts was unacceptable. Kennedy disagreed, arguing that “a rising tide lifts all boats” and that strong economic growth would not continue without lower taxes.)
